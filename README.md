# LoginClient

This is a prototype for a single page web app written with AngularJS. No back-end has been implemented, so the login process is client side only. It has been abandoned to use ZURB Foundation. It now exists only as a demonstration that the author has experience with AngularJS.

Any 'Character Name' and 'Password' combination will be accepted given they are valid.  The home page is just a simple greeting with logout button.
