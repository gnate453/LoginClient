# LoginClient

This is a prototype for a single page web app written with AngularJS. No back-end authenitcation has been implemented.  The login process is client side only. It now exists as a demonstration of AngularJS.

Any 'Character Name' and 'Password' combination will be accepted given they are valid.  The home page is just a simple greeting with logout button.
